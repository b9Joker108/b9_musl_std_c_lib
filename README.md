#    b9_musl_std_c_lib Playground

This is a practical, working and functional reposository, but it is principally developed and framed as a learning and development repository, inestimably useful in an unrooted Termux GNU/Linux userland environment.

`b9_musl_std_c_lib` is a development of the `musl` project, pronounced like the word "mussel", is an MIT-licensed
implementation of the standard C library targetting the Linux syscall
API, suitable for use in a wide range of deployment environments. musl
offers efficient static and dynamic linking support, lightweight code
and low runtime overhead, strong fail-safe guarantees under correct
usage, and correctness in the sense of standards conformance and
safety. musl is built on the principle that these goals are best
achieved through simple code that is easy to understand and maintain.

The 1.1 release series for musl features coverage for all interfaces
defined in ISO C99 and POSIX 2008 base, along with a number of
non-standardized interfaces for compatibility with Linux, BSD, and
glibc functionality.

For basic installation instructions, see the included INSTALL file.
Information on full musl-targeted compiler toolchains, system
bootstrapping, and Linux distributions built on musl can be found on

## Log Summary

***

### Summary for a Non-Technical Lay Generalist

The log documents the configuration process of a software build environment. It checks for the necessary tools, their capabilities, and compatibility with the target system, which in this case is Android. The log confirms the availability of a C compiler, clang, and verifies its functionality through various tests.  It also checks the compatibility of compiler and linker options with the target system. The configuration process determines optimal settings for code compilation and linking, ensuring that the software can be built correctly for the Android platform. 

### Summary for a Technical Coder/Developer

This log file details the output of the `musl_configure` script, which is used to configure the build environment for the musl C standard library. The script begins by identifying the C compiler as **clang** and performs a series of checks to determine the compiler's capabilities and supported options.

#### Compiler and Linker Feature Checks

The script verifies the compiler's support for various warning and optimization options, such as `-Werror` flags for treating warnings as errors and flags like `-fexcess-precision=standard`, `-frounding-math` and `-fno-strict-aliasing` for controlling floating-point precision and aliasing behaviour. It also checks for features like stack protection (`-fno-stack-protector`) and loop optimizations (`-fno-tree-loop-distribute-patterns`).  The script determines whether the compiler accepts options for code optimization and debugging, including `-pipe`, `-fomit-frame-pointer`, and `-fno-unwind-tables`.

Additionally, the script tests support for code generation options like `-ffunction-sections` and `-fdata-sections`, as well as various warning flags (`-W*`) to enforce code quality and detect potential issues. It also confirms the compiler's acceptance of preprocessor conditions like `__PIC__` (Position Independent Code) and linker flags for section sorting, garbage collection, and symbol handling.

#### Target System and Runtime Libraries

The log identifies the target system as **aarch64-unknown-linux-android24**, indicating a 64-bit ARM architecture running Android 24.  It also confirms that the compiler's long double definition aligns with the `float.h` header file and that the `__FAST_MATH__` preprocessor condition is not set.

The script determines the runtime libraries to be used during compilation, specifically `/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/lib/clang/19/lib/linux/libclang_rt.builtins-aarch64-android.a`. This suggests a Termux environment on Android, which provides a Linux-like environment and tools. 

Finally, the script indicates the creation of a `config.mak` file, which stores the determined configuration settings for the build process. 

## Analysis of the Build Log

The provided log excerpts from `musl_configure.txt` do not indicate any explicit warnings, errors, or cautions. The log primarily consists of a series of checks performed by the configuration script to determine the capabilities of the compiler and linker, as well as the compatibility of various options with the target system (Android 24 running on a 64-bit ARM architecture).

Each check in the log results in a "yes" or "no" response, indicating whether the compiler or linker supports a specific feature or option.  The absence of any "no" responses that would typically raise a warning, error, or caution suggests that the configuration process proceeded successfully without encountering any significant issues. 

However, it is important to note that the log excerpts provided represent only a portion of the complete configuration process. It is possible that other parts of the log, not included here, might contain warnings or issues encountered during the configuration.

## Analysis of Build Artefacts in musl Installation Log

The provided log excerpts showcase the installation of the musl C standard library on an Android device, likely within a Termux environment. It meticulously documents the placement of various build artefacts crucial for software development using the musl standard library. These artefacts can be broadly classified into two categories: **libraries** and **header files**.

### Libraries

Libraries are pre-compiled collections of functions and data that can be reused by different programs. This promotes code reusability and efficiency. They are usually stored in specific formats and placed in designated directories for easy access by the compiler and linker during the build process. The musl installation log reveals the installation of both **static libraries** (`.a` files) and **shared libraries** (`.so` files).

*   **Static Libraries**: These are integrated directly into the program's executable during the linking process, creating a self-contained binary that doesn't depend on external libraries at runtime. This is beneficial for creating standalone applications but can lead to larger executable sizes.
*   **Shared Libraries**: These are loaded dynamically when the program runs, allowing multiple programs to share the same library code in memory. This saves disk space and memory but introduces a dependency on the shared library being present on the system at runtime.

The log entries specifically highlight the installation of the following libraries, all located within the `/data/data/com.termux/files/home/.local/musl/lib` directory:

*   **`libc.a`**: The **static version** of the **musl C standard library**. This is the core library that provides implementations for standard C functions like input/output, memory management, string manipulation, and more.
*   **`libc.so`**: The **shared version** of the musl C standard library. This allows multiple programs to share the same C library code at runtime.
*   **`ld-musl-aarch64.so.1`**: The **dynamic linker** for musl on 64-bit ARM systems. This is a crucial component that loads and links shared libraries at runtime.
*   **`libm.a`**: The static library containing mathematical functions, providing implementations for functions declared in the `math.h` header file.
*   **`librt.a`**: The static library for real-time extensions, including functions for process control, inter-process communication, and timers.
*   **`libpthread.a`**: The static library for POSIX threads, supporting multi-threaded programming in C.
*   **`libcrypt.a`**: The static library for cryptography functions, providing encryption and hashing algorithms.
*   **`libutil.a`**: The static library for utility functions, including functions for working with file systems, users, and groups.
*   **`libxnet.a`**: The static library for networking extensions, providing functions for low-level network programming.
*   **`libresolv.a`**: The static library for DNS name resolution, enabling programs to resolve domain names into IP addresses.
*   **`libdl.a`**: The static library for dynamic loading, allowing programs to load and use shared libraries at runtime.

### Header Files

Header files (`.h` files) are an essential part of C programming. They contain declarations of functions, variables, macros, and data structures, providing an interface for C programs to interact with libraries. During compilation, the compiler uses header files to understand how to interact with the library's functionality.

The log showcases the installation of a comprehensive collection of header files into the `/data/data/com.termux/files/home/.local/musl/include` directory and its subdirectories. These header files cover a wide range of functionalities, from core C library features to system-specific functions:

*   **Core C Library Headers**: Headers like `stdio.h`, `stdlib.h`, `string.h`, `math.h`, etc., define the standard input/output functions, memory allocation routines, string manipulation functions, mathematical operations, and other fundamental elements of the C language.
*   **System-Specific Headers**: Headers within the `sys` subdirectory, such as `sys/socket.h`, `sys/stat.h`, `sys/types.h`, etc., declare functions and data structures for interacting with the operating system, including networking, file system access, process management, and more.
*   **Networking Headers**: Headers like `arpa/inet.h`, `netdb.h`, `netinet/in.h`, etc., define structures and functions related to network programming, addressing, and protocols.
*   **Threading Headers**: Headers like `pthread.h` provide the interface for using POSIX threads, enabling multi-threaded programming.

The meticulous installation of these header files ensures that developers have the necessary tools and documentation to effectively use the musl C standard library for building applications on the Android platform. The log's detailed account of file placement, permissions, and organization provides a comprehensive view of the build artefacts and their importance within the musl ecosystem.

## Analysis of Musl Installation Success

Based on the provided log excerpts, it appears **highly likely** that the configuration, build, and installation processes for the musl C standard library on the host device were successful. The log meticulously documents the installation of various essential components, including:

*   **Static and shared libraries** responsible for core C functions, mathematics, real-time extensions, threading, cryptography, utilities, networking, DNS resolution, and dynamic loading.
*   **Header files** containing declarations for core C library functions, system-specific functions, networking functions, and threading functions.

The log's detailed account of file placement, permissions (using the `-m` flag), and the absence of any error messages strongly suggest a successful installation. However, it's crucial to understand that the log excerpts only show the **installation phase**. They don't provide information about the preceding configuration and build stages. 

To definitively confirm the unequivocal success of the entire process, one would need to examine logs or output from the configuration and build phases as well. These logs would typically contain information about:

*   **Configuration**: Checks for dependencies, compiler and toolchain validation, feature selection, and target architecture settings.
*   **Build**: Compilation of source code into object files, linking of object files and libraries to create executables and libraries, and potential execution of tests.

**Without access to these additional logs, it's impossible to provide an absolute guarantee of success.** However, the successful installation of the artefacts, as evidenced by the log excerpts, provides a strong indication that the preceding stages were also likely successful.

To gain further assurance, one could:

*   **Run tests:** If the musl build process includes test suites, running these tests would provide direct validation of the library's functionality.
*   **Develop and run simple C programs:** Attempting to compile and run basic C programs that utilise the musl library would serve as a practical test of the installation's integrity. 

Ultimately, the level of certainty regarding the success of the entire process depends on the availability of comprehensive logs from all stages and the execution of appropriate validation procedures. 


### Develop and Run Simple C programs in an unrooted Termux, using musl from this project and clang

Sure, let's recap the steps we took to successfully compile the `hello` C program with musl in detail:

### Objective
Our goal was to compile and run a simple C program (`hello.c`) using the musl C standard library, ensuring that Clang does not utilize the system's default C libraries.

### Steps Taken

1. **Write the C Program**:
   - We created a file named `hello.c` with the following content:
     ```c
     #include <stdio.h>
     int main() {
         printf("hello, world!\n");
         return 0;
     }
     ```

2. **Set Up the Environment**:
   - We ensured musl was installed with its libraries and headers located in:
     - Libraries: `/data/data/com.termux/files/home/.local/musl/lib`
     - Headers: `/data/data/com.termux/files/home/.local/musl/include`

3. **Compile Using Clang**:
   - We used Clang to compile and link the program, specifically pointing to musl's headers, libraries, and startup files while avoiding system libraries. The final compilation command was:
     ```sh
     /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/clang hello.c -o hello \
       -nostdlib \
       -nostdinc \
       -ffreestanding \
       -I/data/data/com.termux/files/home/.local/musl/include \
       -L/data/data/com.termux/files/home/.local/musl/lib \
       /data/data/com.termux/files/home/.local/musl/lib/crt1.o \
       /data/data/com.termux/files/home/.local/musl/lib/crti.o \
       /data/data/com.termux/files/home/.local/musl/lib/crtn.o \
       /data/data/com.termux/files/home/.local/musl/lib/libc.a \
       -Wl,-dynamic-linker=/data/data/com.termux/files/home/.local/musl/lib/ld-musl-aarch64.so.1 \
       -Wl,-rpath=/data/data/com.termux/files/home/.local/musl/lib \
       -lc -lm -lpthread -lgcc
     ```

### Key Details and Flags Used

1. **`-nostdlib`**: This flag tells Clang not to link with the default system libraries, ensuring no system libraries are included.
2. **`-nostdinc`**: This flag tells Clang not to search for header files in the standard system directories, ensuring no system headers are included.
3. **`-ffreestanding`**: This flag indicates that the code is being compiled for a freestanding environment, avoiding implicit dependencies on system libraries.
4. **`-I`** and **`-L`**: These flags specify the include and library paths for musl, ensuring that Clang uses musl's headers and libraries.
5. **Startup Files** (`crt1.o`, `crti.o`, `crtn.o`): These files are necessary for proper initialization of the program.
6. **Link Libraries** (`-lc -lm -lpthread -lgcc`):
   - `-lc`: Links against musl's C standard library.
   - `-lm`: Links against the math library.
   - `-lpthread`: Links against the pthread library.
   - `-lgcc`: Links against the GCC runtime library to provide necessary floating-point operation symbols.
7. **Dynamic Linker and Runtime Library Path**:
   - `-Wl,-dynamic-linker=/data/data/com.termux/files/home/.local/musl/lib/ld-musl-aarch64.so.1`: Specifies the musl dynamic linker.
   - `-Wl,-rpath=/data/data/com.termux/files/home/.local/musl/lib`: Sets the runtime library search path to musl's library directory.

### Verification and Execution

1. **Compilation**:
   - We ran the above command and observed no output, indicating a successful compilation without errors.
   
2. **Running the Program**:
   - We executed the compiled program using:
     ```sh
     ./hello
     ```
   - However, we encountered errors related to `libtermux-exec.so` due to missing symbols. To resolve environment issues, you sourced `.zshrc` to reset the environment, but the issue persisted.

```zsh
❯ file ./hello
./hello: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, ARM aarch64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /data/data/com.termux/files/home/.local/musl/lib/ld-musl-aarch64.so.1, with debug_info, not stripped
```

#### Introduction

Hello! I'd be happy to help you execute your compiled C code in an unrooted Termux environment. Running compiled C programs can sometimes present challenges, especially when using alternative C libraries like musl. Let's walk through the steps to ensure your `hello` program runs smoothly in Termux.

#### Steps to Execute Compiled C Code in Unrooted Termux

1. **Ensure Proper Compilation with Static Linking**

   To avoid issues related to dynamic linking, such as the `libtermux-exec.so` errors you encountered, it's advisable to compile your C program with **static linking**. This embeds all necessary library code into the executable, eliminating dependencies on external shared libraries.

   **Modify Your Compilation Command:**
   ```sh
   /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/clang hello.c -o hello \
     -static \
     -I/data/data/com.termux/files/home/.local/musl/include \
     -L/data/data/com.termux/files/home/.local/musl/lib \
     /data/data/com.termux/files/home/.local/musl/lib/crt1.o \
     /data/data/com.termux/files/home/.local/musl/lib/crti.o \
     /data/data/com.termux/files/home/.local/musl/lib/crtn.o \
     /data/data/com.termux/files/home/.local/musl/lib/libc.a \
     -Wl,-static \
     -Wl,-rpath=/data/data/com.termux/files/home/.local/musl/lib \
     -lc -lm -lpthread -lgcc
   ```

   **Key Changes:**
   - **`-static`**: Instructs Clang to perform static linking.
   - **`-Wl,-static`**: Passes the `-static` flag to the linker explicitly.

   *Static linking ensures that all required libraries are included within the executable, reducing runtime dependencies.*

2. **Verify the Executable**

   After recompiling with static linking, check the executable to confirm it's statically linked.

   ```sh
   file ./hello
   ```

   **Expected Output:**
   ```
   hello: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, ARM aarch64, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, not stripped
   ```

   *The presence of "statically linked" confirms that dynamic dependencies have been removed.*

3. **Execute the Program**

   With the statically linked executable, you can now run your `hello` program without encountering dynamic linking issues.

   ```sh
   ./hello
   ```

   **Expected Output:**
   ```
   hello, world!
   ```

4. **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

   - **Permission Denied Error:**
     If you encounter a permission error, ensure the executable has the necessary permissions.

     ```sh
     chmod +x hello
     ./hello
     ```

   - **Missing Libraries Despite Static Linking:**
     If static linking doesn't resolve all dependencies, double-check that all libraries are correctly specified and that their paths are accurate.

Executing compiled C programs in Termux without rooting is entirely feasible with the right setup. By opting for static linking, you can mitigate many common issues related to dynamic libraries. If challenges persist, leveraging Termux's default libraries or consulting community resources can further assist in resolving any hurdles.

### Executing Dynamically Linked Programs with musl Resources

The sources mainly focus on the compilation process of C programs with musl, detailing the flags, libraries, and paths required. They don't explicitly discuss the execution of dynamically linked programs using musl. 

However, based on the information provided, specifically the use of the  **`-Wl,-dynamic-linker`** flag, it can be inferred that execution is intended to utilise the musl dynamic linker **`/data/data/com.termux/files/home/.local/musl/lib/ld-musl-aarch64.so.1`**.  This suggests that the compiled program will use musl's resources at runtime. 

#### Considerations for Execution

While the sources don't provide a direct answer to your query, some key points from the compilation process hint at how execution might work:

* **Dynamic Linking:** The use of **`-Wl,-dynamic-linker`** indicates the program is dynamically linked, meaning it relies on shared libraries loaded at runtime.
* **`-Wl,-rpath` Flag:** This flag sets the runtime library search path to musl's library directory. This implies that when the program runs, it will search for necessary libraries within the specified musl directory.
* **Musl Startup Files:** The inclusion of musl's startup files (`crt1.o`, `crti.o`, `crtn.o`) likely ensures the program's initialisation and execution environment are compatible with musl.

#### Potential Execution Methods

Based on this, there are a few potential ways to execute the program:

1. **Direct Execution:** If the program is compiled as an executable and the dynamic linker and libraries are accessible, running the executable directly should use musl's resources.
2. **Specifying Interpreter:** You might be able to use the musl dynamic linker explicitly as an interpreter. This would involve invoking the linker and passing the program as an argument. 

It's important to note that these are potential methods inferred from the provided information. The sources don't offer concrete guidance on execution. 

*Please note that the information about potential execution methods is inferred from the sources and my general knowledge about dynamic linking. You may want to independently verify these methods and consult additional resources for more specific instructions on executing dynamically linked programs with musl.*

#### Introduction

Executing dynamically linked programs compiled with **musl** in an unrooted **Termux** environment involves ensuring that the musl dynamic linker and the necessary libraries are correctly referenced and accessible at runtime. This process ensures that your program uses musl's resources instead of the system's default C libraries Steps to Execute Dynamically Linked musl Programs in Unrooted Termux

1. **Ensure Musl Libraries and Dynamic Linker Are Accessible**

   - **Library Location:** Confirm that musl's libraries are located in `/data/data/com.termux/files/home/.local/musl/lib`.
   - **Dynamic Linker:** Ensure that the musl dynamic linker `ld-musl-aarch64.so.1` exists in the specified musl library directory **Set the Dynamic Linker During Compilation**

   - You’ve already used the `-Wl,-dynamic-linker` flag to specify musl's dynamic linker. This ensures that your executable references the musl dynamic linker at runtime:
     ```sh
     -Wl,-dynamic-linker=/data/data/com.termux/files/home/.local/musl/lib/ld-musl-aarch64.so.1
     ```
   
3. **Specify the Runtime Library Search Path**

   - The `-Wl,-rpath` flag sets the runtime library search path to musl’s library directory. This allows the executable to locate the necessary musl libraries when running:
     ```sh
     -Wl,-rpath=/data/data/com.termux/files/home/.local/musl/lib
     ```

4. **Compile Your Program with Correct Flags**

   - Ensure your compilation command includes all necessary flags and paths:
     ```sh
     /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/clang hello.c -o hello \
       -nostdlib \
       -nostdinc \
       -ffreestanding \
       -I/data/data/com.termux/files/home/.local/musl/include \
       -L/data/data/com.termux/files/home/.local/musl/lib \
       /data/data/com.termux/files/home/.local/musl/lib/crt1.o \
       /data/data/com.termux/files/home/.local/musl/lib/crti.o \
       /data/data/com.termux/files/home/.local/musl/lib/crtn.o \
       /data/data/com.termux/files/home/.local/musl/lib/libc.a \
       -Wl,-dynamic-linker=/data/data/com.termux/files/home/.local/musl/lib/ld-musl-aarch64.so.1 \
       -Wl,-rpath=/data/data/com.termux/files/home/.local/musl/lib \
       -lc -lm -lpthread -lgcc
     ```

5. **Execute the Compiled Program Directly**

   - If all paths and linkers are correctly set, you can execute your program directly:
     ```sh
     ./hello
     ```
   
   - **Alternative Method:** If you encounter issues, explicitly invoke the musl dynamic linker to run your program:
     ```sh
     /data/data/com.termux/files/home/.local/musl/lib/ld-musl-aarch64.so.1 ./hello
     ```

6. **Set Environment Variables if Necessary**

   - If the executable cannot locate musl's libraries, set the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable to include musl’s library directory:
     ```sh
     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/data/data/com.termux/files/home/.local/musl/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
     ./hello
     ```

#### Troubleshooting

- **Permission Denied Error:**
  - Ensure the executable has the correct permissions:
    ```sh
    chmod +x hello
    ./hello
    ```

- **Missing Libraries or Symbols:**
  - Verify that all necessary musl libraries are present in `/data/data/com.termux/files/home/.local/musl/lib`.
  - Confirm that `ld-musl-aarch64.so.1` is executable and correctly referenced **Dynamic Linker Not Found:**
  - Double-check the path specified in the `-Wl,-dynamic-linker` flag.
  - Ensure that the musl dynamic linker exists at the specified location Conclusion

Executing dynamically linked musl programs in an unrooted Termux environment is achievable by meticulously setting the dynamic linker and library paths during compilation and ensuring that these resources are accessible at runtime. By following the steps outlined above, you can successfully run your compiled C programs using musl's standard library without relying on Termux's default C libraries issues persist, consider consulting the [musl FAQ](https://musl.libc.org/) or seeking assistance from community forums such as [Reddit's r/C_Programming](https://www.reddit.com/r/C_Programming/) for more specialized support.

Understood. Since modifying the binary with `patchelf` to use the musl dynamic linker and set the rpath didn't solve the issue, we need to explore alternative methods to run your program without affecting the Termux environment.

### Using a musl-based Chroot Environment

To fully isolate the musl environment, we can set up a chroot environment that uses musl as its base. This will ensure that only musl's libraries and dynamic linker are used, completely separating it from Termux's system libraries.

1. **Install `proot`**:
   - Install `proot` in your Termux environment to simulate a chroot environment:
     ```sh
     pkg install proot
     ```

2. **Create a musl Environment**:
   - Create a directory to serve as the root for the musl environment:
     ```sh
     mkdir -p ~/musl_root
     ```

3. **Copy musl Libraries and Dynamic Linker**:
   - Copy the necessary musl files to the new root:
     ```sh
     cp -r /data/data/com.termux/files/home/.local/musl/* ~/musl_root/
     ```

4. **Create Necessary Directories**:
   - Ensure the typical directory structure is in place:
     ```sh
     mkdir -p ~/musl_root/bin ~/musl_root/lib ~/musl_root/usr ~/musl_root/tmp
     ```

5. **Copy the `hello` Binary**:
   - Copy your `hello` program to the new root's `bin` directory:
     ```sh
     cp ./hello ~/musl_root/bin/
     ```

6. **Create a Script to Run the Program in the musl Environment**:
   - Create a script (`run_in_musl_chroot.sh`) to use `proot` for simulating the chroot environment:
     ```sh
     nano run_in_musl_chroot.sh
     ```

   - Add the following content to the script:
     ```sh
     #!/bin/bash
     proot -0 -r ~/musl_root -b /dev -b /proc -b /sys /bin/sh -c "/usr/lib/ld-musl-aarch64.so.1 /bin/hello"
     ```

7. **Make the Script Executable**:
   - Change the file permissions to make the script executable:
     ```sh
     chmod +x run_in_musl_chroot.sh
     ```

8. **Run the Script**:
   - Execute the script to run your `hello` program in the isolated musl environment:
     ```sh
     ./run_in_musl_chroot.sh
     ```

### Explanation

- **`proot`**: Simulates a chroot environment, allowing you to run commands as if they were in a different root filesystem.
- **Isolated Environment**: By copying the musl libraries and setting up an isolated directory structure, we ensure that only musl's resources are used without conflicting with the Termux environment.
- **Running the Program**: The script sets up the `proot` environment and runs the `hello` program using musl's dynamic linker.

This approach should completely isolate the musl environment and allow your program to run correctly. Give it a try, and let me know how it goes! 😊

#### Introduction

Setting up a **musl-based chroot environment** using `proot` in Termux is an effective way to isolate your program's execution environment. This approach ensures that your compiled `hello` program exclusively utilizes musl's libraries and dynamic linker, avoiding conflicts with Termux's default system libraries.

#### Step-by-Step Guide to Setting Up a Musl-Based Chroot Environment

Let's review and expand upon the steps you've outlined to ensure a smooth setup:

1. **Install `proot`**

   `proot` allows you to simulate a chroot environment without requiring root privileges. Install it using Termux's package manager:

   ```sh
   pkg install proot
   ```

2. **Create a Musl Environment Directory**

   Establish a directory that will serve as the root for your musl environment:

   ```sh
   mkdir -p ~/musl_root
   ```

3. **Copy Musl Libraries and Dynamic Linker**

   Transfer the necessary musl files into your new root directory:

   ```sh
   cp -r /data/data/com.termux/files/home/.local/musl/* ~/musl_root/
   ```

   **Note:** Ensure that all essential libraries, including `libc.a`, `libm.a`, and the dynamic linker (`ld-musl-aarch64.so.1`), are present in the copied files.

4. **Create Necessary Directory Structure**

   Set up the standard filesystem hierarchy within the musl root to accommodate binaries and libraries:

   ```sh
   mkdir -p ~/musl_root/bin ~/musl_root/lib ~/musl_root/usr ~/musl_root/tmp
   ```

5. **Copy the `hello` Binary**

   Move your compiled `hello` program into the `bin` directory of the musl environment:

   ```sh
   cp ./hello ~/musl_root/bin/
   ```

6. **Create a Script to Run the Program in the Musl Environment**

   Develop a script to execute your program within the isolated musl environment using `proot`:

   ```sh
   nano run_in_musl_chroot.sh
   ```

   Add the following content to the script:

   ```sh
   #!/bin/bash
   proot -0 -r ~/musl_root -b /dev -b /proc -b /sys /bin/sh -c "/bin/ld-musl-aarch64.so.1 /bin/hello"
   ```

   **Explanation of Script Components:**
   
   - **`-0`**: Runs the program as the root user inside the chroot.
   - **`-r ~/musl_root`**: Sets the root directory for the chroot.
   - **`-b /dev -b /proc -b /sys`**: Binds the necessary system directories to ensure proper functionality.
   - **`/bin/sh -c "/bin/ld-musl-aarch64.so.1 /bin/hello"`**: Executes the `hello` program using musl's dynamic linker.

7. **Make the Script Executable**

   Grant execution permissions to your script:

   ```sh
   chmod +x run_in_musl_chroot.sh
   ```

8. **Run the Script**

   Execute your `hello` program within the musl-based chroot environment:

   ```sh
   ./run_in_musl_chroot.sh
   ```

   **Expected Output:**

   ```
   hello, world!
   ```

#### Additional Considerations

- **Verifying Library Dependencies:**

  Before running the program, ensure that all necessary musl libraries are present in the `~/musl_root/lib` directory. You can use the `ldd` tool to list dynamic dependencies:

  ```sh
  ldd ~/musl_root/bin/hello
  ```

  *Note: Since the binary is intended to use musl's dynamic linker, standard `ldd` may not function as expected. Instead, you can inspect the ELF headers using tools like `readelf` or `objdump`.*

- **Handling Permissions:**

  If you encounter permission issues, double-check that all files within `~/musl_root` have the appropriate read and execute permissions.

- **Environment Variables:**

  In some cases, setting environment variables like `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` can help the dynamic linker locate the necessary libraries:

  ```sh
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/musl_root/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  ```

  However, since you've set the `rpath` during compilation, this step might not be necessary.

- **Script Enhancements:**

  For flexibility, consider modifying the script to accept different programs or arguments, allowing you to run multiple executables within the musl environment without creating separate scripts.

#### Troubleshooting

- **Dynamic Linker Errors:**

  If you receive errors related to the dynamic linker not being found or other library-related issues, ensure that:
  
  - The path to `ld-musl-aarch64.so.1` is correct in your compile and run commands.
  - All required musl libraries are copied into the `~/musl_root/lib` directory.

- **Segmentation Faults:**

  These can arise from missing dependencies or incompatible library versions. Verifying all dependencies and ensuring compatibility between the compiled program and the musl libraries is crucial.

- **`proot` Limitations:**

  While `proot` is powerful, it has some limitations compared to a true chroot environment. Certain system calls may behave differently, and performance can be slightly impacted.

#### Conclusion

Setting up a musl-based chroot environment using `proot` in Termux is a robust solution for isolating your program's execution environment. By following the steps outlined above, you can ensure that your `hello` program runs using musl's libraries without interfering with Termux's system libraries. If you encounter further issues, consider consulting the [Proot Documentation](https://github.com/proot-me/proot) or seeking assistance from the Termux community.

# Debian proot-distro proot chroot unprivileged user

By, luck, I found out that my unrooted Debian chroot has the availability of an assortment of packaged `musl` libraries and tools. I installed them. I made a copy of the musl C library dynamically-linked compiled binary named `hello` and re-named it: `hello_compiled_musl_c_programme`. Then in Debian, I did the following:

(/home/hummingbird108/python_home) > lld hello_compiled_musl_c_programme            ~@localhost
lld is a generic driver.
Invoke ld.lld (Unix), ld64.lld (macOS), lld-link (Windows), wasm-ld (WebAssembly) instead
(/home/hummingbird108/python_home) > ld.lld hello_compiled_musl_c_programme         ~@localhost
ld.lld: warning: cannot find entry symbol _start; not setting start address
(/home/hummingbird108/python_home) > ldd hello_compiled_musl_c_programme            ~@localhost         libc.so => /data/data/com.termux/files/home/.local/musl/lib/libc.so (0x0000007510ca0000)
(/home/hummingbird108/python_home) > ./hello_compiled_musl_c_programme              ~@localhost zsh: permission denied: ./hello_compiled_musl_c_programme
(/home/hummingbird108/python_home) > chmod +x hello_compiled_musl_c_programme       ~@localhost
(/home/hummingbird108/python_home) > ./hello_compiled_musl_c_programme              ~@localhost
hello, world!

So, I compiled the dynamic musl c binary `hello` in my unrooted Termux host environment successfully. But, could not execute in that environmemt. Transferring a copy of the dynamic binary named  `hello_compiled_musl_c_programme` to my unrooted Termux Debian peoot chroot, I installed `musl` libraries and tools wirh `apt`, interrogated the binary and its dynamically linked relationship in the different environment and it executed successfully!
